# EntropyGate 🛡️
**Zero-Knowledge Password Management for iOS**

EntropyGate is an enterprise-grade security vault that ensures your passwords remain entirely under your control. Built on a **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**, your master key never leaves your device—meaning even we cannot access your data.

## 🏗️ Architecture (Blueprint)
* **Zero-Knowledge Sync:** Data is encrypted locally with AES-256-GCM before being synced to Supabase.
* **Secure Enclave Integration:** Master keys are stored in the hardware-backed iOS Keychain.
* **Performance-First:** Targeted 120fps UI optimization for rapid access and seamless biometric authentication.

## 🛡️ Security (Shield)
* **Mathematics Over Promises:** Security is enforced by client-side encryption, not server-side trust.
* **Data Minimization:** We collect no usage analytics, behavioral tracking, or master passwords.
* **Encryption Standards:** Utilizes Apple's CryptoKit for industry-standard cryptographic operations.

## ⚖️ Legal & Privacy
To comply with App Store requirements and ensure transparency:

* [Privacy Policy](./PRIVACY.md) - Learn how we protect your data without seeing it.
* [Terms of Service](./TERMS.md) - Important disclaimers regarding Master Key recovery.
